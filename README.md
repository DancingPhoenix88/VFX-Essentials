VFX-Essentials
=============

VFX-Essentials is an on-going project that goes through some of the basic building blocks of working with particles in VFX-Graph in the hopes of familiarizing users with building FX in Unity. The samples go over waves, noise, point caches, textures, buffers, interactivity and more. Feel free to explore and use the samples!
